# Discriminating Power of Different Loss Functions on MNIST 
The purpose of this repository is to explore the discriminating power of different loss functions beyond traditional softmax on the MNIST dataset. 

## Categorical Cross-Entropy 
TBD

## Semi-Hard Triplet Loss
TBD

## Large Margin Cosine Loss
TBD
